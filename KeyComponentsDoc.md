## 1. Basic Backlog (You may include a WBS image if you choose)

For each work item/function/smallest piece of your project that needs to be accomplished, *create an entry in the key components doc* of the form:

**Work item/function that needs to be done** 
- How will that be accomplished 
- Is there a library that accomplishes this task (First check the approved Library List) 
- What skills are needed to accomplish this task.

or said more concisely:

**What** 
- How
